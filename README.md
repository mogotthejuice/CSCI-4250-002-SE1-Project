# Scrum Age
### The solution currently consists of three projects.
#### - a Blazor Webassembly User Interface
#### - a Test Console Application User Interface
#### - a Game Class Library
##### The Game Library currently has a dummy class, Fish, that will need to be deleted and replaced with the appropriate classes.  
This dummy class is referenced once in each UI to confirm that the project references are all in order.
